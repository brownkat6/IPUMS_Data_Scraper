## IPUMS Data Scraper
Run 
```python ipums_data.py```
to download all IPUMSI International datasets to the data/ directory within the file. 

### Motivation
IPUMS has census and survey data from around the world. Accessing this provides datasets that could be used train tabular models, as well as evaluate their ability to transfer across tasks or domains, in a setting where domains are well specified (i.e. country).

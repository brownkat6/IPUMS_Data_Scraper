The CPS uses a complex stratified sampling scheme, and ASECWTH must be used to produce unbiased household-level statistics from the IPUMS-CPS ASEC data. For analyses of non-ASEC data, researchers should use HWTFINL. For individual-level analyses, researchers should use WTFINL, ASECWT, or EARNWT. \n\nASECWTH generally has the same value as WTSUPP for the household head or reference person. Vacant housing units and households that could not be interviewed due to residents' absence or refusal to participate have a value of zero in HWTSUPP; such sampled units were included in the public use CPS data beginning in 1988. \n\nEstimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.\n\nTwo important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.\n\nIPUMS-CPS makes available only the most up-to-date weights.

Metropolitan areas are counties or groups of counties centering on a substantial urban area. While the Census Bureau's terminology for metropolitan areas and the classification of specific areas changes over time, the general concept is consistent: a metropolitan area consists of a large population center and adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social interaction.  Metropolitan areas often cross state lines.  See also (METRO), which specifies whether a housing unit was inside or outside the central city of a metropolitan area.  \n\nMETAREA information was added to the ASEC CPS data by the Census Bureau, not collected from respondents.  For 1962-1976, the Census Bureau coded the METAREA data using simple numbering (e.g., from 1 to 15) in the original ASEC CPS public use files.  Beginning with the 1977 survey, the Census Bureau adopted standard FIPS codes for metropolitan areas.  To maximize consistency between IPUMS-CPS and IPUMS-USA, IPUMS-CPS adopts the four-digit codes used in the 1990 census for METAREA.  Along with the codes identifying specific cities, two general codes are used: 9998 (N/A, for households not in metropolitan areas), and 9997 (other metropolitan areas, not identified).  The 9997 code applies to much of the metropolitan area population for years prior to the mid-1980s, when very few metropolitan areas were identified in the CPS data.  For later years, the \"not identified\" code was used when geographic identification would have violated confidentiality requirements.  \n\nThe Census Bureau warns that, \"One set of estimates that can be produced from CPS microdata files should be treated with caution.  These are estimates for individual metropolitan areas.  Although estimates for the larger areas such as New York, Los Angeles, and so forth, should be fairly accurate and valid for a multitude of uses, estimates for the smaller metropolitan areas (those with populations under 500,000) should be used with caution because of the relatively large sampling variability associated with these estimates.\" \nIPUMS CPS discontinued updates to METAREA after December 2022; however, it will continue to be available for 1962-2022 samples.

EARNWT should be used for any analysis including a small number of person-level variables (EARNWEEK, HOURWAGE, PAIDHOUR, and UNION). Researchers should use ASECWTH for household-level analyses. ASECWTCVD is available for the 2020 ASEC to adjust for nonrandom nonresponse resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nUser Caution: For analyses that include the 2014 ASEC sample, please see the comparability tab.\n\nThe ASEC CPS files include two groups of people who are not included in the production of published labor force statistics: (1) members of the armed services, and (2) members of the Hispanic oversample who were interviewed in months other than March. WTFINL and EARNWT assign these groups a value of 0. Both groups are assigned non-zero values in ASECWT.\n\nASECWT is based on the inverse probability of selection into the sample and adjustments for the following factors: failure to obtain an interview; sampling within large sample units; the known distribution of the entire population according to age, sex, and race; over-sampling Hispanic persons; to give husbands and wives the same weight; and an additional step to provide consistency with labor force estimates from the basic survey. \n\nEstimates on the entire population are prepared by projecting forward the resident population from the last available census. These projections are derived by updating the demographic census data from a number of other data sources that account for death, births and net migration. About 3 years after every census (i.e. 2003 for the 2000 Census and 2013 for the 2010 Census), the Census Bureau updates its independent population control and provides a new weight for the relevant years.\n\nTwo important points should be noted here. First, the lag between when the Census is conducted and when the CPS weights are updated is about 3 years. While the Census data are being processed, the CPS files are made available using the weighting scheme from the US Census prior to the latest Census. Second, once the files are updated, the old weights become obsolete and are replaced in the IPUMS data extract system. Published estimates from the lag years that use the old weights are not always updated. For example, 2010 poverty estimates were released in ASEC using the 2000 population controls. Once the 2010 population controls were made available, IPUMS-CPS replaced the ASEC 2010, 2011, and 2012 weights that are based on the 2000 population control with weights that are based on the 2010 population controls.

The Census family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family. Any family level variable depends directly on this variable in that all members of each CPS-identified family unit are assigned the same value for any given family level variable. The Census Bureau poverty statistics are developed with the family interrelationships defined by FTYPE. \n\nRecall that a household includes the related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also counted as a household. For more on the Census family definitions, see below as well as the description for FAMREL.\n\nA family household is a household maintained by a householder who is in a family (as defined above), and includes any unrelated people (unrelated subfamily members and/or secondary individuals) who may be residing there. The number of family households is equal to the number of families. The count of family household members differs from the count of family members, however, in that the family household members include all people living in the household, whereas family members include only the householder and his/her relatives.\n\nA primary family consists of a married couple with or without children, or one parent with one or more own never married children under 18 years old, who maintain the household.\n\nA nonfamily householder consists of a householder living alone (a one-person household) or where the householder shares the home exclusively with people to whom he/she is not related. \n\nA subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old. A subfamily does not maintain their own household, but lives in the home of someone else.\n\nA related subfamily is a married couple with or without children, or one parent with one or more own never married children under 18 years old, living in a household and related to, but not including, the person or couple who maintains the household. One example of a related subfamily is a young married couple sharing the home of the husbands or wife's parents. The number of related subfamilies is not included in the count of families.\n\nAn unrelated subfamily (formerly called a secondary family) is a married couple with or without children, or a single parent with one or more own never-married children under 18 years old living in a household. Unrelated subfamily members are not related to the householder. An unrelated subfamily may include people such as guests, partners, roommates, or resident employees and their spouses and/or children. The number of unrelated subfamily members is included in the total number of household members, but is not included in the count of family members.\n\nSecondary individuals (formerly called unrelated individuals) are people of any age who reside in a household, but are not related to the householder (except unrelated subfamily members). People who reside in group quarters are also secondary individuals. Examples of a secondary individual include (1) a guest, partner, roommate, or resident employee; (2) a foster child; or (3) a person residing in a rooming house, a halfway house, staff quarters at a hospital, or other type of group quarters.\n\nFor more information, see the Census Bureau's page on CPS definitions.", "label": "Family Type", "numpy_type": "<class 'int'>", "codes": {"Primary family": 1, "Nonfamily householder": 2, "Related subfamily": 3, "Unrelated subfamily": 4, "Secondary individual": 5, "Missing": 9}}, "FAMREL": {"description": "FAMREL states the person's relationship to their Census-defined subfamily unit. The Census subfamily type is identified in FTYPE. Values of Census family-level variables such as FTOTVAL are valid for the respective subfamily unit.\n\nNote that IPUMS and the Census Bureau define subfamilies differently. Subfamilies in IPUMS CPS can be identified using the variables MOMLOC, POPLOC and SPLOC. Any subfamilies identified using these variables are not necessarily the same as any Census subfamilies. The IPUMS-defined variable FAMUNIT identifies families according to IPUMS rules (not Census rules), but does not identify (related) subfamilies. FAMREL and FTYPE refer to Census-defined subfamilies. See here for a description of IPUMS subfamilies and their relation to Census subfamilies. IPUMS CPS does not currently offer IPUMS subfamily identifiers such as IPUMS USA's SUBFAM. Below is a brief description of the Census family/subfamily concept as it concerns FAMREL.\n\nEach CPS household has one person designated as the householder, who is the person in whose name the housing unit is rented or own. The CPS splits households into family, subfamily, and individual units. The primary family is the householder and everyone related to the householder. For the purposes of FAMREL and FTYPE, and following some CPS documentation, \"primary family\" will be used as shorthand for \"primary family only\", or the householder and his/her immediate family: that is, the primary family less any subfamily units. In addition to the primary family, a household can also contain subfamily units related to the primary family (related subfamily, or subfamily units that are extended family to the householder), as well as unrelated subfamily units, which are immediate family units with no relation to the householder. Additionally, the household can contain individuals who are not part of any family/subfamily unit, such as guests, boarders, or individual resident employees (i.e. those not living with the resident employee's family). Finally, the householder can also be someone without any relatives in the household, and so is not part of any family unit. More details on the family composition of households and the official CPS definitions can be found in the description for FTYPE. \n\nFor the purposes of FAMREL, each subfamily (including the \"primary family only\" subfamily) has a reference person. Thus the \"reference person\" for FAMREL can be in the primary family or any other subfamily unit. (Note that in some CPS documentation the term \"reference person\" refers to the householder only; FAMREL, which is based on the CPS variable PRFAMREL/A-FAMREL, uses the term slightly differently). \n\nNote that since FAMREL gives the relationship to the subfamily unit, which may not be the entire household, the relationship given by FAMREL is not necessarily the same as the individual's relationship to the householder (RELATE). Thus, for example, a grandchild of the household head could be the reference person of a related subfamily. Additionally, since FAMUNIT is IPUMS-derived and also does not identify related subfamilies, the family identified by FAMUNIT will be different from the subfamily unit that FAMREL refers to. \n\nSince FAMREL identifies the way in which the individual is related to the subfamily unit, for most years a child (FAMREL=3) can be of any age, and if under 18 can be or have been married. \"Not a family member\" refers to nonfamily householders or individuals unrelated to any subfamily units in the family (secondary individuals).", "label": "Relationship to family", "numpy_type": "<class 'int'>", "codes": {"Not a family member": 0, "Reference person": 1, "Spouse": 2, "Child": 3, "Other relative (primary family only)": 4, "Missing": 9}}, "EMPSTAT": {"description": "EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed.

See LABFORCE for a dichotomous variable identifying whether a person participated in the labor force.\n\nIn the CPS, individuals' employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week.  Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as \"at work.\"  Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading \"has job, not at work last week.\"\n\nBecause the CPS is designed to measure unemployment in the civilian population, the original employment status variable in the survey classifies members of the armed forces as NIU (Not in universe).\n\nUnemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force.

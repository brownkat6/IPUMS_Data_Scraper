A family household consists of a household head and one or more persons who are related to the household head by birth, marriage, or adoption and who are living together in the same household.

In theory, the standard error of an estimate measures the variation of a statistic across multiple samples of a given population. Researchers can use replicate weights to mirror this theoretical approach when only sample data is available, and the resulting standard errors have a higher degree of precision than standard asymptotic standard errors. \n\nThe 2005-onward ACS and PRCS samples contain eighty replicate weights at the household level (variables named REPWT1 through REPWT80) and eighty at the person level (variables named REPWTP1 through REPWTP80). The Census Bureau produced these weights by using what is known as the successive difference replication (SDR) method.  This involves repeated implementations of the initial (full-sample) weighting algorithm, such that full information about the ACS and PRCS samples are available in the replicate weights.  Nevertheless, users should use these replicate weights only for generating variance estimates, not for obtaining unique parameter estimates.\n\nUser Note: The successive difference replication approach (SDR) is different from other methods for creating replicate weights such as balanced repeated replication (BRR) and jackknife estimation, and standard statistical software packages have no built-in method to handle them. However, Stata's jackknife standard error program can be adapted to calculate replicate standard errors for CPS data; see the IPUMS-USA replicate weights FAQ page for details.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible for replicate weights to take negative values for certain cases; again, users should use these weights only for variance estimation purposes and not to obtain independent estimates.", "label": "Household replicate weights [80 variables]", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {"0": "Repwt not available", "1": "Repwt available"}}, "CLUSTER": {"description": "CLUSTER is designed for use with STRATA in Taylor series linear approximation for correction of complex sample design characteristics.

Specifically, DENSITY gives the population-weighted geometric mean of the population densities of census tracts in each PUMA.\n\nDENSITY uses tract population densities from the nearest decennial census. In 2000 samples, DENSITY uses 2000 census tract densities. In ACS and 2010 decennial census samples, DENSITY uses 2010 densities.\n\nDENSITY reports a population-weighted average density rather than the density of the whole PUMA (total PUMA population divided by PUMA area) because the population-weighted density better represents the typical local density among PUMA residents. For example, in a PUMA in southern Florida, most of the population may reside in dense developments near the coast, but if most of the PUMA's area is comprised of unpopulated interior wetlands, the whole PUMA's density would be much lower than the high urban density where most PUMA residents live. This PUMA's average tract density, weighted by tract populations (so each PUMA resident's local density is given equal weight), would be appropriately high, corresponding with a typical PUMA resident's local context.\n\nUsing a geometric mean corresponds to measuring the average density on a logarithmic scale, which is suitable because population densities generally have a log-normal distribution (highly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution with a long positive tail). For such distributions, the geometric mean is appropriately less sensitive to large outliers, more sensitive to variations among small values, and generally closer to the median than is the arithmetic mean. In practical terms, a logarithmic scaling makes sense because a difference between densities of 10 and 100 is about as significant for the character of a place as any other factor-of-10 difference (e.g., 1,000 and 10,000), and it is clearly more significant than an equal absolute difference of 90 at high densities (e.g., 10,010 and 10,100).\n\nThe specific steps to compute DENSITY are 1) multiply each tract's population by the logarithm of its density (population divided by land area), 2) sum these products for all tracts in each PUMA, 3) divide the sum for each PUMA by the total PUMA population, and 4) exponentiate the results to return to a linear scaling of population densities. (In the first step, if a PUMA boundary subdivides a tract, we use the whole tract's density, but we limit the population weight to the portion that also resides in the PUMA.)\n\nFor a detailed explanation and demonstration of the DENSITY measure (as well as the METPOP00 and METPOP10 variables), see:\n\nSchroeder, J. and J.

The 2013 MSAs are the first to be based on 2010 standards and 2010 census data.\n\nMET2013 is available only for 2000 and later samples. Another variable, METAREA, identifies metro areas for earlier samples. Both variables are available for samples from 2000 through 2011. The Comparability section summarizes differences between the two variables.\n\nInexact Correspondence with Official Delineations\nSince 1990, the only sub-state-level geographic information available in census PUMS data is for PUMAs, areas which occasionally straddle official metro area boundaries. Given this limitation, MET2013 cannot identify the exact set of households residing in each metro area.\n\nThe protocol used by MET2013 is to identify the metro area in which the majority of each PUMA's population resided. If MET2013 identifies a metro area for a given household, it indicates that, for the PUMA in which the household resided, a majority of the PUMA's 2010 population resided in the identified metro area.\n\nMatch Errors and Code Suppression\nMET2013's code assignment protocol yields errors of omission (residents of a MSA who are not identified as residents) and errors of commission (non-residents who are identified as residents). PUMAs often nest well within metro area boundaries, resulting in small match errors, if any. For many metro areas, however, especially smaller metro areas, the intersecting PUMAs are a poor match.\n\nAs an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded PUMAs) and percent commission error (the portion of the population in associated PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).\n\nMET2013 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more.\n\nFor each reported MET2013 code, the MET2013ERR variable identifies the level of the sum of errors. Researchers may use MET2013ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.\n\nTo compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for ACS and PRCS samples and 2000 populations for 2000 samples. For samples that use 2000 PUMA definitions (which includes the 2000 samples and ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.\n\nFor more detailed information about PUMA-MSA relationships and MET2013 match errors, IPUMS

(MSA).\n\nMET2013's code assignment protocol yields errors of omission (residents of a MSA who are not identified as residents) and errors of commission (non-residents who are identified as residents). As an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded PUMAs) and percent commission error (the portion of the population in associated PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).\n\nFor each reported MET2013 code, MET2013ERR identifies the level of the sum of errors.\n\nMET2013 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more. Researchers may use MET2013ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.\n\nTo compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for ACS and PRCS samples and 2000 populations for 2000 samples. For samples that use 2000 PUMA definitions (which includes the 2000 samples and ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.\n\nFor more detailed information about PUMA-MSA relationships and MET2013 match errors, IPUMS provides these tables (in Excel spreadsheets):\n\n2000 5% sample:\n\nCrosswalk Between 2013 MSAs and 2000 PUMAs with 2000 Populations\n\nPUMA Match Summary by MSA\n2005-2011 ACS and PRCS samples:", "label": "Coverage error in MET2013 variable", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {"0": "Not applicable (no metro area identified)", "1": "Less than 0.1%", "2": "0.1 to 0.9%", "3": "1.0 to 1.9%", "4": "2.0 to 4.9%", "5": "5.0 to 9.9%", "6": "10.0 to 14.9%"}}, "METPOP10": {"description": "METPOP10 reports the average 2010 population of metro/micro areas in each Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). Where a PUMA lies entirely within a single metro area, this \"average\" is simply the metro area's population. Elsewhere, METPOP10 gives an approximation of the typical population size of the commuting systems where PUMA residents live.\n\nSpecifically, METPOP10 provides the population-weighted geometric mean of the 2010 populations of core-based (metropolitan/micropolitan) statistical areas (CBSAs), using the 2013 CBSA delineations of the Office and Management and Budget (OMB). For PUMA residents who live outside of any CBSA, METPOP10 uses county populations to approximate the commuting system population. (For Virginia \"independent cities\" that lie outside of CBSAs, we combine the populations of the independent cities with the populations of their neighboring counties.)\n\nUsing a geometric mean corresponds to measuring the average population on a logarithmic scale, which is suitable because CBSA and county populations generally have a log-normal distribution (highly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution with a long positive tail). For such distributions, the geometric mean is appropriately less sensitive to large outliers, more sensitive to variations among small values, and generally closer to the median than is the arithmetic mean. In practical terms, a logarithmic scaling makes sense because a difference between populations of 100,000 and 500,000 is about as significant for the character of a commuting system as any other factor-of-5 difference (e.g., 1 million and 5 million), and it is clearly more significant than an equal absolute difference of 400,000 in large commuting systems (e.g., 10.1 million and 10.5 million).\n\nThe specific steps to compute METPOP10 are 1) compute the populations of all spatial intersections (i.e., overlaps) between PUMAs and counties, 2) multiply each intersection's population by the logarithm of the population of the encompassing CBSA or noncore county, 3) sum these products for all intersections in each PUMA, 4) divide the sum for each PUMA by the total PUMA population, and 4) exponentiate the results to return to a linear scaling of populations.\n\nFor a detailed explanation and demonstration of the METPOP10 measure (as well as the DENSITY variable), see:\n\nSchroeder, J. and J.

PUMA definitions are altered after each decennial census, so PUMA codes are not consistently comparable across time.\n\nTo support spatio-temporal analysis of PUMS data, IPUMS defines ConsPUMAs as minimally aggregated sets of PUMAs that, when consolidated, align well across samples.\n\nDifferent versions of ConsPUMAs correspond to different vintages of PUMAs. The 0010 version represents areas that are consistent among 2000 and 2010 PUMAs.\n\nA separate variable, CONSPUMA, identifies sets of 1980 county groups and 1990 and 2000 PUMAs that comprise comparable populations for samples from 1980 through 2011.\n\nConstruction Process and Mismatch Errors\nTo construct 0010 ConsPUMAs, we applied an aggregation algorithm that groups together 2010 PUMAs iteratively until the total population mismatch between each set of 2010 PUMAs and its closest matching set of 2000 PUMAs falls below 1% for both the 2000 and 2010 populations.\n\nSpecifically, to compute mismatch errors, we first sum, for each intersection between 2000 and 2010 PUMAs, the populations of census blocks that have their center in the intersection according to 2010 Census TIGER/Line files. We then compute the percent omission error (the percent of 2010 PUMAs' population that resides outside of 2000 PUMAs) and percent commission error (the percent of 2000 PUMAs' population that resides outside of 2010 PUMAs) for each ConsPUMA. We sum these two statistics to obtain final mismatch scores.\n\nWe compute mismatch separately for 2000 and 2010 populations in order to ensure that the mismatch between the 2000 and 2010 PUMAs associated with each ConsPUMA is acceptably small (below 1%) at both times.\n\nThe CPUMA0010 Summary, available via the 0010 ConsPUMA Geographic Tools page, provides the mismatch errors for each ConsPUMA. That page also provides a 2000-2010 PUMA crosswalk file that includes the block-based 2000 and 2010 populations for each intersection between PUMAs.\n\nThe algorithmic approach we use for 0010 ConsPUMAs differs from the process used to construct the original CONSPUMA variable. In that case, researchers visually inspected boundaries and \"hand selected\" ConsPUMA sets whose boundaries were closely (if not exactly) in alignment. The visual approach can ensure minimal levels of spatial mismatch, but small areas of mismatch may occasionally contain substantial populations, and large areas of mismatch may contain very small populations. Therefore, the visual approach may occasionally merge PUMAs unnecessarily or fail to merge PUMAs where the population mismatch is in fact large. In contrast, the new population-based algorithm is more consistent and reliable with respect to population mismatch.\n\nMore information on the exact steps of the algorithm will be provided in a forthcoming paper.", "label": "Consistent PUMA, 2000-2010", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {"1085": null}}, "HOMELAND": {"description": "HOMELAND indicates whether the household is in a PUMA that includes any Census block that was designated as an American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian homeland area.\n\nFor Census 2000, the Census Bureau indicated whether or not each census block was within a homeland area.

Calculating the standard error of an estimate enables the construction of a confidence interval around the sample estimate of interest and may also be used in hypothesis testing. \n\nIn theory, the standard error of an estimate measures the variation of a statistic across multiple samples of a given population. Researchers can use replicate weights to mirror this theoretical approach when only sample data is available. \n\nThe 2005-2007 ACS and PRCS samples contains eighty replicate weights at the household level (variables named REPWT1 through REPWT80) and eighty at the person level (variables named REPWTP1 through REPWTP80). The Census Bureau produced these weights by using what is known as the Successive Difference Replication (SDR) method, which involves repeated implementations of the initial weighting algorithm. \n\nTo calculate standard errors, users should generate 80 separate estimates using each of the 80 replicate weights. Along with the single full-sample estimate that can be generated using PERWT or HHWT, this information can then be used to compute the standard error of the estimate with this formula provided by the Census Bureau:\nwhere r is the number of replicates (1-80), \nX is the full-sample estimate based on the unbiased weights (either PERWT or HHWT),Xr is the replicate estimate based on the r-th set of replicate weights.Once calculated, the standard error is useful for constructing confidence intervals and in hypothesis testing.\n\nThis method is a more precise alternative to the method of generating standard errors described in the SUBSAMP variable description. SUBSAMP allows users to divide an IPUMS sample into 100 component parts and then to generate subsample estimates for each of those parts. Replicate weights allow users to generate 80 replicate estimates, each of which uses full sample data. Thus, instead of calculating the variation among 100 small subsample estimates as one would do using SUBSAMP, replicate weights allow for calculating the variation among eighty full-size estimates, using REPWT(P)1-REPWT(P)80. \n\nStandard errors computed using replicate weights are almost always more accurate than those computed using subsamples. Estimates generated with replicate weights have more cases involved since each estimate uses all sample data rather than 1/100th of all of the sample data. Furthermore, the replicate weights themselves are constructed by the Census Bureau with full sampling information that is not available in samples prior to 2005. Additional information about replicate weights is available in the 2005 ACS PUMS Accuracy Statement . \n\t\nUser Note: The successive difference replication approach (SDR) is different from other

PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.\n\nFor further explanation of the sample weights, see \"Sample Designs\" and \"Sample Weights\".

Sample line variables can be identified by looking at the universe tab for the variable of interest.  The use of SLWT is not necessary in analyses of 1940 and 1950 data that do not use any sample line variables.\n\nThe use of SLWT is particularly critical in 1940, because the sample-line records in that year are not representative. In 1950, sample line persons are a flat 1-in-330 sample of the population. In both 1940 and 1950, SLWT has a value of zero for non-sample-line persons.\n\nAn alternative to using SLWT is to use the SELFWTSL variable to select an un-weighted represented subset of sample line cases. \n\nFor a further explanation of sample weights, see \"Sample Line Characteristics in 1940 and 1950\" and \"Sample Weights\".", "label": "Sample-line weight", "numpy_type": "float", "codes": {}}, "REPWTP": {"description": "REPWTP provides 80 separate person-level weights that allow users to generate empirically derived standard errors. Household-level replicate weights are available in REPWT.\n\nMore information about replicate weights is available on the IPUMS-USA replicate weights FAQ page, in the 2005 ACS PUMS Accuracy Statement, and in this Census Bureau document written for the Current Population Survey.\n\nCalculating the standard error of an estimate enables the construction of a confidence interval around the sample estimate of interest and may also be used in hypothesis testing. In theory, the standard error of an estimate measures the variation of a statistic across multiple samples of a given population. Researchers can use replicate weights to mirror this theoretical approach when only sample data is available, and the resulting standard errors have a higher degree of precision than standard asymptotic standard errors. \n\nThe 2005-onward ACS and PRCS samples contain eighty replicate weights at the household level (variables named REPWT1 through REPWT80) and eighty at the person level (variables named REPWTP1 through REPWTP80). The Census Bureau produced these weights by using what is known as the successive difference replication (SDR) method.  This involves repeated implementations of the initial (full-sample) weighting algorithm, such that full information about the ACS and PRCS samples are available in the replicate weights.  Nevertheless, users should use these replicate weights only for generating variance estimates, not for obtaining unique parameter estimates.\n\nUser Note: The successive difference replication approach (SDR) is different from other methods for creating replicate weights such as balanced repeated replication (BRR) and jackknife estimation, and standard statistical software packages have no built-in method to handle them. However, Stata's jackknife standard error program can be adapted to calculate replicate standard errors for CPS data; see the IPUMS-USA replicate weights FAQ page for details.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible for replicate weights to take negative values for certain cases; again, users should use these weights only for variance estimation purposes and not to obtain independent estimates.", "label": "Person replicate weights [80 variables]", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {"0": "Repwtp not available", "1": "Repwtp available"}}, "FAMUNIT": {"description": "FAMUNIT indicates to which family within the housing unit each person belongs.

"ANCESTR1 provides the respondent's self-reported ancestry or ethnic origin. In all years except 1990 and 2000, respondents could give as many ancestries as they saw fit. ANCESTR1 records the first response, while ANCESTR2 records the second response, if one exists. Additional responses were ignored, with the exception of 17 \"three-origin\" combination codes retained in the 1980 samples; these are described in section A of the comparability discussion below. Some compound responses such as \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" or \"French Canadian\" were treated as a single response. Respondents could give virtually any response, though they were instructed not to give a religion (the census is not allowed to collect information on religion).  A few responses were not categorized in the samples and were instead coded \"Uncodable,\" \"Deferred Cases,\" or \"Other.\" These uncategorized responses were usually religions. \n\nIf a respondent listed both a broad category and a subset of that category, such as \"German-Bavarian,\" the Census Bureau used only the subset and ignored the broad category. \n\nThe IPUMS generally follows the Census Bureau's practice of coding responses alphabetically within geographic regions. Note that some responses, especially within the NORTH AMERICAN (NON-HISPANIC) geographic region, denote people such as \"African-American,\" \"French-Canadian,\" or \"American\" whose responses indicate origins outside of the geographical region within which coding schemes have placed them. Some similar responses might therefore appear in separate places.\n\nUser Caution: The labels associated with each IPUMS ancestry value do not contain all of the possible responses included within each ancestry code. To ensure that they use all codes that are necessary to their research, users are advised to examine the codes and frequencies table and the detailed components of the ancestry values (see

In all years except 1990 and 2000, respondents could give as many ancestries as they saw fit. ANCESTR1 records the first response, while ANCESTR2 records the second response, if one exists. Additional responses were ignored, with the exception of 17 \"three-origin\" combination codes retained in the 1980 samples; these are described in section A of the comparability discussion below. Some compound responses such as \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" or \"French Canadian\" were treated as a single response. Respondents could give virtually any response, though they were instructed not to give a religion (the census is not allowed to collect information on religion).  A few responses were not categorized in the samples and were instead coded \"Uncodable,\" \"Deferred Cases,\" or \"Other.\" These uncategorized responses were usually religions. \n\nIf a respondent listed both a broad category and a subset of that category, such as \"German-Bavarian,\" the Census Bureau used only the subset and ignored the broad category. \n\nThe IPUMS generally follows the Census Bureau's practice of coding responses alphabetically within geographic regions. Note that some responses, especially within the NORTH AMERICAN (NON-HISPANIC) geographic region, denote people such as \"African-American,\" \"French-Canadian,\" or \"American\" whose responses indicate origins outside of the geographical region within which coding schemes have placed them. Some similar responses might therefore appear in separate places.\n\nUser Caution: The labels associated with each IPUMS ancestry value do not contain all of the possible responses included within each ancestry code. To ensure that they use all codes that are necessary to their research, users are advised to examine the codes and frequencies table and the detailed components of the ancestry values (see

OCC1990 provides researchers with a consistent classification of occupations using the 1990 coding scheme as its starting point. It spans the period from 1950 forward. Researchers who want consistent occupations prior to 1950 should consult OCC1950. \n&nbsp;The Census Bureau has reorganized its occupational classification system in almost every census administered since 1850.  All original occupational information is stored in the OCC variable.  The meaning of codes in the OCC variable changes with each census year.  \n\nWe chose the 1990 coding scheme as the standard for OCC1990 so that no year's occupational data would be forced to bridge both of the two most significant changes in twentieth-century coding schemes: from 1970 to 1980 and from 1990 to 2000.  In OCC1990, all samples from 1950 onward bridge no more than one of these major shifts.  For this reason, the variable may be preferable to OCC1950 for the samples from 1980 onward.  Sensitivity testing suggests that OCC1990 performs very similarly to OCC1950 for most purposes.While the 1990 Census occupation classification system is the basis for OCC1990, we combine several categories to improve the variable's comparability over time. Users are encouraged to review the BLS working paper that describes the variable and how available categories map to 1960-2000 Census occupation codes.\n\nCreation of OCC1990\nOCC1990 was created using a series of technical papers published by the Census Bureau shortly after each census was administered.  These papers provide detailed analyses of how the occupational coding scheme for each census year differed from the scheme used during the previous census year.  These occupational \"crosswalks\" are based on samples of cases that are \"double coded\" into the occupational schemes of the current and previous census year.  The original Census Bureau crosswalks are available via links in \"Occupation and Industry Variables\" of the IPUMS documentation. \n\nUsing the information from the occupational crosswalks, we traced the proportion of each occupation as it broke out into more specific occupations or as it was combined with others into a more general occupation.  To take one example from the technical paper produced after the 2000 census: of persons coded as \"Gaming managers\" in 2000 (2000 code 33), the Census Bureau determined that 35% would have been coded as \"Managers, service organizations\" in 1990 (1990 code 21), while 65% would have been coded as \"Managers, food serving and lodging establishments\" (1990 code 17).  In OCC1990, we assign original 2000 OCC values of 33 to 17.  We generated the same information for every occupational code in every census year from 1950-2000. \n\nResearchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) then used the resulting tables to create aggregated occupational categories that were more useful for long-term analyses; these are the categories that are used in the IPUMS variable OCC1990.  More specifics on their methods and a detailed comparison of OCC1950 and OCC1990 can be found in the resulting BLS working paper. \n\nThe IPUMS codes differ from those outlined in the BLS working paper in two instances. \n&nbsp;In the BLS working paper, persons with the occupation of \"Parking Enforcement Workers\" (2000 code 384) were coded as \"Housekeepers, maids, butlers, stewards, and lodging quarters cleaners\" (1990 code 405). IPUMS assigns a code of 423 to these cases in OCC1990, which corresponds to \"Other law enforcement: sheriffs, bailiffs, correctional institution officers\". The double-coded crosswalks from the Census Bureau show that 100% of persons coded as \"Parking Enforcement Workers\" in 2000 would have been coded as \"Other law enforcement: sheriffs, bailiffs, correctional institution officers\" under the 1990 coding scheme. \n\nThe second difference is for code 874 in the 1990 census occupation, which is labeled as \"Helper-production worker\". The BLS working paper assigns these cases to \"Laborers outside construction\" (1990 code 889), but separately includes the occupation \"Helper-production worker\" with a code of 873; note that code 873 for occupation does not exist in the 1990 PUMS. IPUMS retains the original value of 874 with the label of \"Helper-production workers\" in OCC1990 and does not include an occupation code of 873. \n\nWhile OCC1990 has fewer occupational categories than the original 1990 occupational scheme, users may want to further aggregate categories into the broad occupational categories implicit in the 1990 scheme:  \n\nManagerial and Professional (000-200);\n\nTechnical, Sales, and Administrative (201-400);\n\nService (401-470);\n\nFarming, Forestry, and Fishing (471-500);\n\nPrecision Production, Craft, and Repairers (501-700);\n\nOperatives and Laborers (701-900);\n\nNon-occupational responses (900-999).\nUniverse Note: \"New Workers\" are persons seeking employment for the first time, who had not yet secured their first job.", "label":

2010 ACS occupation classification scheme.  Similar variables are offered for the 1950 (OCC1950) and 1990 (OCC1990) classifications. OCC2010 offers researchers a consistent, long-term classification of occupations.    \n\nThe Census Bureau has reorganized its occupational classification system in almost every census administered since 1850.  All original occupational information is stored in the OCC variable.  The meaning of codes in the OCC variable changes with each census year.  The 2010 occupation coding scheme for OCC has 493 categories.  In the interest of harmonization, however, the scheme has been modified to achieve the most consistent categories across time.  That is, some categories that provide more detail in the 2010 scheme were grouped together because earlier categories are inseparable when more than one occupation is coded together.  For users who wish to further aggregate occupation to broader categories, the 2010 scheme is generally organized by the following groups:\n\nManagement, Business, Science, and Arts = 10-430\nBusiness Operations Specialists = 500-730\nFinancial Specialists = 800-950\nComputer and Mathematical = 1000-1240\nArchitecture and Engineering = 1300-1540\nTechnicians = 1550-1560\nLife, Physical, and Social Science = 1600-1980\nCommunity and Social Services = 2000-2060\nLegal = 2100-2150\nEducation, Training, and Library = 2200-2550\nArts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media = 2600-2920\nHealthcare Practitioners and Technicians = 3000-3540\nHealthcare Support = 3600-3650\nProtective Service = 3700-3950\nFood Preparation and Serving = 4000-4150\nBuilding and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance = 4200-4250\nPersonal Care and Service = 4300-4650\nSales and Related = 4700-4965\nOffice and Administrative Support = 5000-5940\nFarming, Fishing, and Forestry = 6005-6130\nConstruction = 6200-6765\nExtraction = 6800-6940\nInstallation, Maintenance, and Repair = 7000-7630\nProduction = 7700-8965\nTransportation and Material Moving = 9000-9750\nMilitary Specific = 9800-9830\nUnemployed (no occupation for 5+ years) or Never Worked = 9920\n\nWe followed a process of constructing and testing OCC2010 that is similar to OCC1990's process, which is discussed in more detail in this BLS working paper.\n\nOCC1990 was created using a series of technical papers published by the Census Bureau shortly after each census was administered.  These papers provide detailed analyses of how the occupational coding scheme for each census year differed from the scheme used during the previous census year.  These occupational \"crosswalks\" are based on samples of cases that are \"double coded\" into the occupational schemes of the current and previous census year.  The original Census Bureau crosswalks are available via links in \"Occupation and Industry Variables\" of the IPUMS documentation. \n\nUsing the information from the occupational crosswalks, we traced the proportion of each occupation as it broke out into more specific occupations or as it was combined with others into a more general occupation.  To take one example from the technical paper produced after the 2000 census: of persons coded as \"Gaming managers\" in 2000 (2000 code 33), the Census Bureau determined that 35% would have been coded as \"Managers, service organizations\" in 1990 (1990 code 21), while 65% would have been coded as \"Managers, food serving and lodging establishments\" (1990 code 17).  Thus, OCC1990 assigns a code of 17 to the cases in the 2000 IPUMS sample having an original 2000 OCC value of 33.  We generated the same information for every occupational code in every census year from 1950-2000. \n\nResearchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) then used the resulting tables to create aggregated occupational categories that were more useful for long-term analyses.  We have performed a variety of tests to ensure that the new categories are as robust as possible over the long-term.  More specifics on their methods and a detailed comparison of OCC1950 and OCC1990 can be found in the BLS Working Paper on the topic.", "label": "Occupation, 2010 basis", "numpy_type": "int", "codes":

Like IND1950, IND1990 offers researchers a consistent long-term classification of industries.    \n\nThe Census Bureau has reorganized its industrial classification system in almost every census administered since 1940.  All original industry information is stored in the IND variable.  The meaning of codes in the IND variable changes with each census year.  We chose the 1990 scheme as the standard for IND1990 so that no year's industry data would be forced to bridge both of the two most significant changes in twentieth-century coding schemes: from 1970 to 1980 and from 1990 to 2000.  In IND1990, all samples from 1950 onward bridge no more than one major change in twentieth-century industrial coding schemes.  For this reason, the variable may be preferable to IND1950 for the samples from 1980 onward.  Sensitivity testing suggests that IND1990 performs very similarly to IND1950 for most purposes.\n\nIND1990 was created using a series of technical papers published by the Census Bureau shortly after each census was administered.  These papers provide detailed analyses of how the industrial coding scheme for each census year differed from the scheme used during the previous census year.  These industrial \"crosswalks\" are based on samples of cases that are \"double coded\" into the industrial schemes of the current and previous census year.  The original Census Bureau crosswalks are available via links in \"Occupation and Industry Variables\" of the IPUMS documentation. \n\nUsing the information from the industrial crosswalks, we traced the proportion of each industry as it broke out into more specific industries or as it was combined with others into a more general industry.  To take one example from the technical paper produced after the 2000 census: of persons coded in \"Footwear\" in 2000 (2000 code 177), the Census Bureau determined that 11% would have been coded as \" Other rubber products, and plastics footwear and belting\" in 1990 (1990 code 211), while 89% would have been coded as \" Footwear, except rubber and plastic\" (1990 code 221).  Thus, IND1990 assigns a code of 221 to the cases in the 2000 IPUMS sample having an original 2000 IND value of 177.

It expresses each family's total income for the previous year as a percentage of the poverty thresholds established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently revised in 1980, adjusted for inflation (see the poverty definition page for more information). POVERTY assigns all members of each family - not each household - the same code. POVERTY is also calculated for most adults living as unrelated individuals. For the 1950-2000 censuses, the reference period for income is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period is the preceding 12 months from the date of interview.\n\nWhether an individual falls below the official \"poverty line\" depends not only on total family income, but also on the size of the family, the number of people in the family who are children, and the age of the householder (under/over age 65). POVERTY was created using detailed income and family structure information about each individual and calculating the family income as a percentage of the appropriate official poverty threshold. For example, if a person's family income is $20,000 and the poverty threshold for such a person is $13,861, then the value of POVERTY for that individual is $20,000/$13,861 * 100 percent, or 144. Individuals whose family income is more than five times the appropriate poverty threshold receive a POVERTY value of 501. For more detail on the precise poverty thresholds used for the POVERTY variable, see the poverty definition page.\n\nIn POVERTY, the IPUMS evaluates poverty status individually for each distinct family unit in the household, as defined in FAMUNIT. For example, all persons related to the household head receive the same poverty value as the head, while an unrelated person and her child would share their own value distinct from that of the primary family. As mentioned in the FAMUNIT variable description, it is possible for individuals identified as being non-relatives of the head (RELATE) to be included in the primary family (FAMUNIT 1), based on family pointer information. However, because the POVERTY values for primary families in the 2000 Decennial and ACS/PRCS samples are published in the PUMS by the Census Bureau (see User Caution below) and the Census Bureau strictly excludes \"non-relatives\" (RELATED &gt; 1100) from primary families, some individuals identified as FAMUNIT 1 by IPUMS USA will not have the same POVERTY value as the head of household. These individuals will instead have the single-person poverty calculation assigned to them by the Census Bureau.\n\nThe original PUMS samples for years prior to 1990 did not include a poverty variable. Original PUMS samples from 1990 onward included poverty values, but IPUMS poverty values differ from the original PUMS values in a key way. The original PUMS samples treated all households members unrelated to the head as one-person families when assigning poverty values, even if such persons were part of a secondary family (i.e., persons living with their own relatives but not related to the household head). Thus, the original PUMS poverty measures do not account for the presence of children (or any other aspect of family size and composition) in secondary families. For example, in the original 1990 PUMS sample, a woman unrelated to the householder who has a child would receive a poverty value appropriate for a single person with a given income, rather than for a two-person family with a child. Consequently, the original PUMS samples from 1990 onwards tend to underestimate poverty. In the IPUMS, by contrast, the POVERTY value would be based on the threshold fitting the secondary family consisting of both the mother and the child. The IPUMS samples also round to the nearest poverty value, while the original census PUMS samples always round up.\n\nUser Caution: The incomes of the highest-earning individuals are \"top-coded\" in the 2000 census data, the ACS and the PRCS samples (see 2000 income top codes). In the 2000-present period, for individuals in the first family unit of every household (cases where FAMUNIT=1), POVERTY uses the poverty values in the original PUMS samples, which are based on respondents' pre-top-coded income information. The POVERTY value for some of these cases will differ from calculations one could make by hand using the available information in the top-coded income variables. As noted above, the IPUMS calculates POVERTY values for members of secondary families, and these values are based on top-coded income information. (Like the ACS, the IPUMS also uses the income adjustment factor before calculating poverty, although use of this factor is not recommended with IPUMS data. See the ACS income standardization note for more information.) This variable also includes some valid values for group quarters (GQ) residents, even though the stated universe does not include such cases. Users who want to maintain a consistent universe should manually exclude group quarters residents.", "label": "Poverty status", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {}}, "OCCSCORE": {"description": "OCCSCORE is a constructed variable that assigns occupational income scores to each occupation.

We strongly urge researchers to read our  user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.\n\nUsing data from the 1989 General Social Survey (GSS) and the 1990 census, Hauser and Warren regressed the occupational prestige ratings (i.e., the started logit of percentage of 5 or higher ratings on the nine-point scale used in the 1989 GSS) on occupational education (i.e., the started logit of percentage of all occupational incumbents who had completed one or more years of college) and occupational earnings (i.e., the started logit of percentage of all occupational incumbents who earned $14.30 per hour or more in 1989). The resulting statistical model was used to generate socioeconomic scores for the entire rage of 1990 occupations. The HWSEI is, therefore, the weighted sum of occupational education and occupational earnings. \n\nFor more information, see R. M. Hauser and J. R. Warren \"Socioeconomic Indexes for Occupations: A Review, Update, and Critique,\" Sociological Methodology  27 (1997): 177-298; and K. Nakao and J. Treas, \"Updating Occupational Prestige and Socioeconomic Scores: How the New Measures Measure Up,\" Sociological Methodology  24 (1994): 1-72.\n\nHauser and Warren developed this measure to be applicable to datasets with occupational data coded to the 1990 census occupational scheme. For the purpose of comparability across time, the IPUMS version of HWSEI uses the modified version of the 1990 occupational classification scheme available in OCC1990. Several 1990 occupation categories were aggregated in modified version of the 1990 occupational classification scheme.

In all surveys, respondents were asked to evaluate either \"general standing\" or \"social standing\" of occupations. In the 1963 NORC survey (a replication of the 1963 North-Hatt study), respondents were asked to rate occupations with a scale of \"excellent,\" \"good,\" \"average,\" \"somewhat below average,\" and \"poor.\" In the 1964 Hodge-Siegel-Rossi survey and the 1965 supplementary surveys, on a cardboard sheet showing a nine-rung ladder of social standing that ranged from \"1\" being the lowest social standing to \"9\" being the highest social standing, respondents were asked to sort cards with occupational titles. Using data from these multiple surveys, Siegel transformed occupational prestige rating data into a common metric.\n\nFor more information, see P. M. Siegel, \"Prestige in the American Occupational Structure,\" Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago, 1971.\n\nSiegel's original prestige score was based on the 1960 occupational classification scheme, which contained a slightly larger number of categories than the 1950 occupational classification scheme. In the few cases where we had to aggregate 1960 categories to harmonize them with the 1950 scheme, the prestige score was calculated as the weighted average of the 1960 occupational categories (based on the prestige value and number of cases in each 1960 category). There were also two cases where the 1950 scheme had more detail than the 1960 scheme used by Siegel (OCC1950 categories 10-29 and 600-615 were each combined into single 1960 categories). In those cases, we assigned the 1960 prestige score to all of the 1950 categories.\n\nAlternative measures of occupational standing that are based on OCC1950 are available in EDSCOR50, ERSCOR50, NPBOSS50, OCCSCORE, and SEI.

Respondents were asked to evaluate \"social standing\" of occupations in this survey.\u00a0 More specifically, on a cardboard sheet showing a nine-rung ladder of social standing that ranged from \"1\" being the lowest social standing to \"9\" being the highest social standing, respondents were asked to sort cards with occupational titles. Nakao and Treas then converted these data into prestige score using the following formula: \n\n\nwhere  Pj is the prestige score of the jth occupation, i is the rank of social standing, and  Xji is the proportion of ratings received by the jth occupation that fell on the ith rung of the ladder. \n\nTherefore, the prestige score is a weighted average of the ratings received by each occupation, with weights of 0, 12.5, 25.0 ... 100, assigned to the respective rating categories.\u00a0 Prestige scores can range from 0 to 100.\n\nFor example, if 70 percent of respondents ranked occupation title A  as \"9,\" 10 percent as \"8,\" and 20 percent as \"7,\" the prestige score for the occupation title A  is 86.25 or [12.5 \u00d7 (9-1) \u00d7 0.7] + [12.5 \u00d7 (8-1) \u00d7 0.1] + [12.5 \u00d7 (7-1) \u00d7 0.2]  = 86.25.\n\nFor more information, see K.

ERSCOR50 reports the percentage of persons in occupations having lower standardized median earnings than the respondent's occupation. The scores were based on the earnings levels of the employed civilian labor force aged 16 and above, excluding persons who did not work in the past one year.\n\nERSCOR50 values were created in two steps. The first step was to derive a standardized z-score for earnings in each occupational category. These scores indicated the number of standard deviations by which each occupational category differed from the mean earnings of all occupations.  The second step in creating ERSCOR50 was to convert these standardized z-scores to a percentile rank. For example, the median earned income for occupation category 625 (Bus drivers) was $3,050 in 1950. This occupational category's ERSCORE50 value of 64 indicates that 64% of workers are in occupations having lower standardized median earned incomes than that of bus drivers. \n\nFrom 1990 onward, these calculations rely in the INCEARN variable.

income for each occupation using the modified version of the 1990 occupational classification scheme available in the OCC1990 variable. \n\nIn order to maximize comparability over time, the median earned income reported in ERSCOR90 is standardized as a \"z-score\" and then converted to a percentile rank. ERSCOR90 reports the percentage of persons in occupations having lower standardized median earnings than the respondent's occupation. The scores were based on the earnings levels of the employed civilian labor force aged 16 and above, excluding persons who did not work in the past one year.\n\nERSCOR90 values were created in two steps. The first step was to derive a standardized z-score for earnings in each occupational category. These scores indicated the number of standard deviations by which each occupational category differed from the mean earnings of all occupations.  The second step in creating ERSCOR90 was to convert these standardized z-scores to a percentile rank. For example, the median earned income for occupation category 808 (Bus drivers) was $11,748 in 1990. This occupational category's ERSCOR90 value of 17 indicates that 17% of workers are in occupations having lower standardized median earned incomes than that of bus drivers. \n\nFrom 1990 onward, these calculations rely in the INCEARN variable. From 1950-1980, these calculations rely on the sum of the variables specified below:\n\n\n\n   \n    1950\n    1960\n    1970\n    1980\n  \n   \n    INCWAGE\n    INCWAGE\n    INCWAGE\n    INCWAGE\n  \n   \n    INCBUSFM\n    INCBUSFM\n    INCBUS\n    INCBUS\n  \n   \n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n    INCFARM\n    INCFARM\n  \n\n\n\n\nAlternative measures of occupational standing that are based on OCC1990 are available in EDSCOR90, HWSEI, NPBOSS90, and PRENT. For information on occupational standing measures, see see \"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS.\"\n\nUser caution: There is significant debate about the usefulness of composite measures of occupational standing (in the IPUMS, these variables include SEI, HWSEI, NPBOSS50, and NPBOSS90). We strongly urge researchers to read our  user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.", "label": "Occupational earnings score, 1990

respondent's occupational category who had completed one or more years of college.\n\nThis variable relies on the modified version of the 1950 occupational classification scheme available in the OCC1950 variable. EDSCOR50 is derived by using educational attainment information (available in EDUC) for the employed civilian labor force aged 16 and up, excluding persons who did not work in the past year.\n\nFor years prior to 1950, occupations are assigned the EDSCOR50 value derived from the 1950 data.\n\nThe OCC1950 categories 12-29 (professors and instructors) were treated as one single category in the process of deriving EDSCOR50, since there were not enough cases to be kept as separate categories. All these occupational categories have the same value of EDSCOR50.\n\nAlternative measures of occupational standing measures that are based on OCC1950 are available in ERSCOR50, NPBOSS50, OCCSCORE, PRESGL, and SEI. For information on the construction of OCC1950 and occupational standing measures, see \"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS.\"\n\nUser Note: There is significant debate about the usefulness of composite measures of occupational standing (in the IPUMS, these variables include SEI, HWSEI, NPBOSS50, and NPBOSS90). We strongly urge researchers to read our  user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.", "label": "Occupational education score, 1950

respondent's occupational category who had completed one or more years of college. This variable relies on the modified version of the 1990 occupational classification scheme available in the OCC1990 variable.  EDSCOR90 is derived by using educational attainment information (available in EDUC) for the employed civilian labor force aged 16 and above, excluding persons who did not work in the past year.  \n\nAlternative measures of occupational standing that are based on OCC1990 are available in ERSCOR90, HWSEI, NPBOSS90, and PRENT. For information on occupational standing measures, see \"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS.\"\n\nUser Note: There is significant debate about the usefulness of composite measures of occupational standing (in the IPUMS, these variables include SEI, HWSEI, NPBOSS50, and NPBOSS90). We strongly urge researchers to read our  user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.", "label": "Occupational education score, 1990

IPUMS instead identifies counties, where possible, from Migration PUMAs (MIGPUMA).\n\nMIGCOUNTY1 identifies a county if and only if:\n\nit was coterminous with a single Migration PUMA; or\n\nit contained multiple Migration PUMAs, none of which extended into other counties.\nFor a listing of the counties that MIGCOUNTY1 identifies, see the \"MIG-PW\" sheets in this Excel document:\n\nCounties Identified in IPUMS USA Samples\n", "label": "County of residence 1 year ago", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {}}, "MIGMET131": {"description": "For respondents who lived in a different residence 1 year before the survey date, MIGMET131 identifies the metropolitan area where the respondent lived at that time, if the prior residence was in an identifiable metropolitan area.\n\nA metropolitan area, or metro area, is a region consisting of a large urban core together with surrounding communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with the urban core.\n\nMIGMET131 identifies metro areas using the 2013 definitions for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The 2013 MSAs are the first to be based on 2010 standards and 2010 census data.\n\nThe metro area delineations and codes used by MIGMET131 are consistent with those used by MIGMET135, which identifies the metro area of residence five years ago for decennial census samples.\n\nNote that the 00000 code applies to individuals who lived in the same residence 1 year ago as well as those whose previous residence was not in an identifiable metro area. Users who wish to distinguish these two conditions should use MIGRATE1 in conjunction with MIGMET131.\n\nInexact Correspondence with Official Delineations\nIPUMS determines MIGMET131 codes based on Migration PUMAs (MIGPUMA1).\n\nBecause Migration PUMAs occasionally straddle official 2013 MSA boundaries, MIGMET131 cannot identify the exact set of households residing in each metro area.\n\nThe protocol IPUMS uses for MIGMET131 is to identify the MSA in which the majority of each Migration PUMA's population resided. If MIGMET131 identifies a metro area for a given respondent, it indicates that, for the Migration PUMA in which the respondent previously resided, a majority of the 2010 population resided in the identified metro area.\n\nMatch Errors and Code Suppression\nMIGMET131's code assignment protocol yields errors of omission (residents of a metro area who are not identified as residents) and errors of commission (non-residents who are identified as residents). Migration PUMAs often nest within MSA boundaries, resulting in small match errors. For many metro areas, however, especially smaller metro areas, the Migration PUMAs are a poor match.\n\nAs an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded PUMAs) and percent commission error (the portion of the population in associated PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).\n\nMIGMET131 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more.\n\nFor each reported MIGMET131 code, the MIGMET13ERR variable identifies the level of the sum of errors. Researchers may use MIGMET13ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.\n\nTo compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for all ACS and PRCS samples. For samples that use 2000 Migration PUMA definitions (ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 Migration PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.\n\nFor more detailed information about relationships between Migration PUMAs and MSAs and about MIGMET131 match errors, IPUMS provides these tables (in Excel spreadsheets):\n\n2005-2011 ACS and PRCS samples:\n\nCrosswalk Between 2013 MSAs and 2000 Migration PUMAs\n\nMIGMET131 Omission and Commission Errors by

In the census of 1840, a special volume was issued that gave the names, ages, and places of residence of pensioners of the Revolutionary War or other U.S. military service, but other veterans were not identified. An inquiry on veterans was undertaken in the census of 1890, and summary statistics on surviving veterans of the Union and Confederate Armies were published. A question on veteran status was also included in the census of 1910, but it referred only to veterans of the Civil War and was evidently omitted by many enumerators. The 1930, 1940, and 1950 censuses included more detailed veteran questions. The 1940 census also identified the spouses and children (under age 18) of veterans, as well as the mortality status of the veteran husbands/fathers.\n\nData on veteran status in the 1940 and 1950 censuses were not satisfactory. Age and type-of-service entries were sometimes inconsistent, and non-reporting was relatively high. Furthermore, the totals did not correspond well with figures compiled by the Veterans Administration. The location of the question on the schedule may have been responsible for some of the errors. Because of these problems, the results of these original inquiries were not published.\n\nThe wording of the question on veteran status for the 1990-2000 censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS was expanded from the veteran/not veteran question in 1980, to include questions on current active duty status and service or training in the military Reserves and the National Guard. The expansion was intended to clarify the appropriate response for persons in the armed forces and for persons who had served in the National Guard or military Reserve units only.

In 1940, veteran status was extended to service in peacetime, as well as during wars and expeditions. Periods of service identified on the form changed over time, with 1980 on distinguishing between various time periods after the Korean War. The 1990 census added a question on total years of military service (see VETYRS). The 2000 census, the ACS, and the PRCS included a question on length of active-duty military service, which distinguished between those with less than two years versus two or more years of service.\n\nDefinition of Veteran\nPrior to 1990, a \"veteran\" is defined as a civilian of a certain age (which varied by year) who had formerly served in the armed forces of the United States. Beginning in 1980, women were included in the definition. In the 1990-2000 censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS persons currently in the armed forces were defined as veterans.\n\nFrom 1940 on, \"service\" is defined as active duty in the United States Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard for any length of time and at any place at home or abroad. For 1970 on, participation in the National Guard or military Reserves counts as \"service\" only for those called to active duty (e.g., during World War II, the Korean War, or the Persian Gulf War); training or attendance at weekly meetings is not \"service.\" The 1990 census defined work as a Merchant Marine Seaman during World War II as active duty.\n\nCensus forms differed in what they specifically excluded from the definition of military service. The following activities were never counted as military service: (1) civilian employment or volunteer activities for the Red Cross, USO, Public Health Service, or the War, Navy, and Defense Departments; 2) Merchant Marine employment outside of World War II; 3) service in the armed forces of another country.\n\nVETSTAT indicates whether individuals served in the military forces of the United States (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) in time of war or peace. \"Service\" included active duty in these branches of the military for any length of time and at any place at home or abroad. \n\nSince the census, ACS, and PRCS data on veterans are based on self-reported responses, they differ from data from other sources, such as administrative records of the Department of Defense.

In the Bureau's printed tabulations, persons serving in at least one wartime period are classified by their most recent wartime service. In contrast, the dichotomous veteran variables in the IPUMS preserve information about all reported periods of service for each veteran.

The 2013 MSAs are the first to be based on 2010 standards and 2010 census data.\n\nInexact Correspondence with Official Delineations\nIPUMS determines PWMET13 codes based on Place-of-Work PUMAs (PWPUMA00), which are the only sub-state geographic units identified in the source PUMS data for place of work.\n\nBecause Place-of-Work PUMAs occasionally straddle official MSA boundaries, PWMET13 cannot identify the exact set of respondents who worked in each metro area.\n\nThe protocol IPUMS uses for PWMET13 is to identify the MSA in which the majority of each Place-of-Work PUMA's population resided. If PWMET13 identifies a metro area for a given respondent, it indicates that, for the Place-of-Work PUMA where the respondent worked, a majority of the 2010 population resided in the identified metro area.\n\nMatch Errors and Code Suppression\nPWMET13's code assignment protocol yields errors of omission (workers in a metro area who are not identified as workers there) and errors of commission (respondents identified as working in a metro area who worked elsewhere). Place-of-Work PUMAs often nest within MSA boundaries, resulting in small match errors. For many metro areas, however, especially smaller metro areas, the Place-of-Work PUMAs are a poor match.\n\nAs an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent population omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded Place-of-Work PUMAs) and percent population commission error (the portion of the population in associated Place-of-Work PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).\n\nPWMET13 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more.\n\nFor each reported PWMET13 code, the PWMET13ERR variable identifies the level of the sum of errors. Researchers may use PWMET13ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.\n\nTo compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for all ACS and PRCS samples. For samples that use 2000 Place-of-Work PUMA definitions (2000 samples and ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 Place-of-Work PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.\n\nThe actual omission and commission errors for workers of a metropolitan area may differ substantially from the errors based on residents. IPUMS uses resident counts to compute mismatches because worker counts are not available for small areas, as needed to compute counts for all intersections between Place-of-Work PUMAs and MSAs.\n\nFor

and the actual 2013 metropolitan statistical area (MSA).\n\nThe code assignment protocol of PWMET13 yields errors of omission (workers in a metro area who are not identified as workers there) and errors of commission (respondents identified as working in a metro area who worked elsewhere).\n\nAs an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent population omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded Place-of-Work PUMAs) and percent population commission error (the portion of the population in associated Place-of-Work PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).\n\nFor each reported PWMET13 code, PWMET13ERR identifies the level of the sum of errors.\n\nPWMET13 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more. Researchers may use PWMET13ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.\n\nTo compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for all ACS and PRCS samples. For samples that use 2000 Place-of-Work PUMA definitions (2000 samples and ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 Place-of-Work PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.\n\nThe actual omission and commission errors for workers of a metropolitan area may differ substantially from the errors based on residents. IPUMS uses resident counts to compute mismatches because worker counts are not available for small areas, as needed to compute counts for all intersections between Place-of-Work PUMAs and MSAs.\n\nFor more detailed information about relationships between Place-of-Work PUMAs and MSAs, IPUMS provides these tables (in Excel spreadsheets):\n\n2000 5% sample:\n\nCrosswalk Between 2013 MSAs and 2000 Place-of-Work PUMAs\n\nPWMET13 Omission and Commission Errors by MSA, 2000\n2005-2011 ACS and PRCS samples:", "label": "Coverage error in PWMET13 variable", "numpy_type": "int", "codes": {"0": "Not applicable (no metro area identified)", "1": "Less than 0.1%", "2": "0.1 to 0.9%", "3": "1.0 to 1.9%", "4": "2.0 to 4.9%", "5": "5.0 to 9.9%", "6": "10.0 to 14.9%"}}, "PWTYPE": {"description": "PWTYPE indicates whether respondents who worked last week worked primarily within a metropolitan area (codes 1-4), and, if so, whether they worked within a metropolitan central/principal city (codes 1-3).\n\nA metropolitan area is a region consisting of a large urban core together with surrounding communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with the urban core. See METAREA for more information.\n\nIn cases where the metropolitan and central/principal-city status of the place of work are not directly identified in the source microdata, IPUMS derives PWTYPE codes based on other available geographic information, e.g., place-of-work county groups (PWCNTYGP) or Public Use Microdata Areas (PWPUMA and PWPUMA00).
